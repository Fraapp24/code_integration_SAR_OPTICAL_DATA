# code_integration_SAR_OPTICAL_DATA

In this study, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical data are both considered for Earth surface classification. Specifically, the integration of Sentinel-1 (S-1) and Sentinel-2 (S-2) data is carried out through supervised Machine Learning
(ML) algorithms implemented on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform for the classification of a particular region of interest.
Achieved results demonstrate how in this case radar and optical remote detection provide complementary information, benefiting surface cover classification and generally leading to increased mapping accuracy. In addition, this paper works in the direction
of proving the emerging role of GEE as an effective cloud-based tool for handling large amounts of satellite data. The code has been made open source and the repository to the paper has been added.
